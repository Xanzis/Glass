# Glass

An interpreter for the [Glass](https://esolangs.org/wiki/Glass) esolang. I'm hoping to make something a little more verbose than the reference implementation so I can write more complicated programs in the language.

## Current Status:
I think I've ironed the bugs out of the variable system and the standard operators. Loops and function calls are working well enough to run other peoples' example programs (provided they use the standard classes available so far) Next up is implementing the rest of the standard library and revisiting some of the parts I skipped over to get this thing running.

Things I'm happy with:
- The parser does its job correctly
- The overall structure of the interpreter is sound, as far as I can tell

Things the interpreter doesn't do so well:
- Recursion (each function call mallocs enough memory to assign **every** name a value)

What I'm working on:
[] Implementing the rest of the standard Glass library (only A and O done so far)
[] Implementing autogenerated variables
[X] Testing loops, function calls
[] Building a garbage collector for the system
[] Finding a better way to do string handling
[] Implementing floats properly (though the language spec is unclear)
[] Providing better error handling for use in writing new Glass programs

This is a long list of tasks, but I'm hoping to get the big stuff implemented soon. Advice and pull requests welcome.
