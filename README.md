# Glass

An interpreter for the Glass esolang. I'm hoping to make something a little more verbose than the reference implementation so I can write more complicated programs in the language.

## Current Status:
The Hello World program runs!

Things I'm happy with:
- The parser does its job correctly, as far as I can tell
- The overall structure of the interpreter is sound, as far as I can tell

What I'm working on:
- Implementing the rest of the standard Glass library (only A and O done so far)
- Implementing autogenerated variables
- Testing loops, function calls
- Building a garbage collector for the system
- Finding a better way to do string handling
- Implementing floats properly (though the language spec is unclear)

This is a long list of tasks, but I'm hoping to get the big stuff implemented soon. Advice and pull requests welcome.
